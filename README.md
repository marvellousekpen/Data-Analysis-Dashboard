Are shipping costs consistent across providers?
## Process

## Project insight
- Sales increased by ~233% from 2013 to 2014 but dropped by ~29% in 2015.
- Côte de Blaye generates ~10.3% of total revenue, with worst-sellers (e.g., Chocolate and Louisiana Hot Spiced Okra) contribute less than 0.3% each.
- Top customers (QUICK, SAVEA, ERNSH) contribute ~25% each to total revenue, while smaller customers (HUNGO, RATTC) contribute less than 5% combined.
- United Package accounts for ~70% of shipping costs, significantly higher than Federal Shipping and Speedy Express.
- Total Revenue: $1,354,459; Shipping Costs: $64,943; Avg. Revenue/Order: $629.
## Recommendation 
Increase revenue by tackling the 29% sales decline in 2015, highlighting best-sellers, and reevaluating products contributing under 0.3%. Prioritize expanding smaller customer accounts (<5% revenue) and cutting United Package’s 70% share of shipping costs.
